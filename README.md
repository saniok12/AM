# AM (Artificial Microcosm)

AM is a Python-written program that simulates decision-making through a simple, weighted numerical decision tree based on a rationality parameter. Designed as both a simulation and a framework, AM models various personality-driven choices — such as addiction dynamics — by further refining its decision-making parameters.

## Overview

At its core, AM uses a weighted decision-making algorithm where each available action is evaluated based on how much it improves key parameters (like energy, health, and happiness) relative to their current state. The AI then chooses between a rational (optimal) choice and a random one, with the balance determined by the user-specified rationality parameter.

## Expandability

AM is designed to be infinitely expandable:
- **Personality Modules:**  
  New modules can be added to simulate different personality traits or behaviors, such as varying levels of risk-taking, impulsivity, or addiction.
  
- **Action Choices:**  
  Developers can easily add new actions with associated outcomes and even incorporate complex behavioral feedback (like addiction growth, recovery, and tolerance).
  
- **Framework for Modeling:**  
  While AM starts with a simple decision-making tree, its framework supports the integration of further refinements, enabling it to simulate a wide range of human-like decision processes.

## Use Cases

- **Decision-Making Simulations:**  
  Model how different rationality levels affect an AI’s ability to maximize its outcomes.
  
- **Personality-Driven Behavior:**  
  Explore how additional factors—such as addiction predisposition and dynamic feedback loops—impact long-term behavior.
  
- **Framework for Research:**  
  Serve as a flexible base for experiments in personality modeling, behavioral economics, or even emergent decision-making phenomena.

AM (Artificial Microcosm) not only simulates human life choices but also provides a foundation for developers to explore and model complex personality traits and decision dynamics in a controlled, modular environment.
